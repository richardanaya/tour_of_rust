  content_markdown: >
    So far all of our code examples have been a single file. Let's discuss how
    our code can be better organized and shared by others!
- title: Modules
  content_markdown: |
    Every Rust program or library is a *crate*.

    Every crate is made of a hierarchy of *modules*.

    Every crate has a root module.

    A module can hold global variables, functions, structs, traits or even other modules!

    In Rust there is not a 1 to 1 mapping of files to the module tree hierarchy. We must build the module tree explicitly by hand in our code.
- title: Writing a Program
  content_markdown: |
    A program has a root module in a file called `main.rs`.
- title: Writing a Library
  content_markdown: |
    A library has a root module in a file called `lib.rs`.

    Items in modules can be referenced with their full module path
    `std::f64::consts::PI`.


    A simpler way is the **use** keyword. It allows us to specify particular
    items from modules we want

    to use throughout our code without a full path. For instance `use
    std::f64::consts::PI`

    allows me to just use the identifier `PI` in my main function.


    **std** is the crate of the **standard library** of Rust which is full of
    useful data

    structures and functions for interacting with your operating system.


    A searchable directory of crates created by the community can be found at
    [https://crates.io](https://crates.io/).
- title: Referencing Multiple Items
  content_markdown: |
    Multiple items can be referenced in a single module path as so:

    ```rust
    use std::f64::consts::{PI,TAU}
    ```

    Ferris doesn't eat TAU, he only eats PI.
- title: Creating Modules
  content_markdown: |
    When we think of code, we usually imagine a hierarchy of files organized
    in directories. Rust lets you create modules closely related to your file
    structure.

    There are two ways in Rust to declare a module. For example, a module
    `foo` can be represented as:
      * a file named `foo.rs`
      * a directory named `foo` with a file `mod.rs` inside
- title: Module Hierarchy
  content_markdown: >
    A module can depend on another one. In order to establish a relationship

    between a module and its sub-module, you must write in the parent module:


    ```rust

    mod foo;

    ```


    The declaration above  will look for a file named `foo.rs` or `foo/mod.rs`
    and

    will insert its contents inside a module named `foo` under this scope.
- title: Inline Module
  content_markdown: >
    A sub-module can be directly inlined within a module's code.


    One very common use for inline modules is creating unit tests. We create an
    inline module that only exists when Rust is used for testing!


    ```

    // This macro removes this inline module when Rust 

    // is not in test mode.

    #[cfg(test)]

    mod tests {
        // Notice that we don't immediately get access to the 
        // parent module. We must be explicit.
        use super::*;

        ... tests go here ...
    }

    ```
- title: Internal Module Referencing
  content_markdown: >
    Rust has several keywords you can use in your `use` path to quickly get
    ahold of the module you want:
      
    * `crate` - the root module of your crate

    * `super` - the parent module of your current module

    * `self` - the current module
- title: Exporting
  content_markdown: >
    By default members of a *module* are not accessible from outside of the
    module (not even to its child modules!). We make members 

    of a module accessible using the `pub` keyword.


    By default members of a *crate* are not accessible outside of the crate. We
    make members of

    a crate accessible by marking them as `pub` in the *root module* of your
    crate (`lib.rs` or `main.rs`).
- title: Structure Visibility
  content_markdown: >
    Just like functions, structures can declare what they want exposed outside
    of their module using `pub`.

- title: Prelude
  content_markdown: |
    You might be wondering how we have access to `Vec` or `Box`
    everywhere without a `use` to import them. It is because of the module
    `prelude` in the standard library.

    Know that in the Rust standard library anything that is exported in
    `std::prelude::*` is automatically available to every part of Rust.
    That is the case for `Vec` and `Box` but others as well (Option, Copy,
    etc.).
- title: Your Own Prelude
  content_markdown: >
    Because of standard library's prelude, it's common for your libary to have
    its own prelude module as a starting point for 

    where users should import all of the most common data structures for using
    your library (e.g `use my_library::prelude::*`).

    It doesn't automatically get used in programs/libraries that use your crate,
    but it's a good convention to follow so people

    know where to start.


    Ferris says, "Be a good rustacean and help a fellow crab out with a good
    prelude!"
- title: Chapter 9 - Conclusion
  content_markdown: >
    You now have a few tricks up your sleeve when it comes to creating Rust
    applications and libraries ready for the world. Don't

    worry about remembering it all. As your library grows and is used by other
    people, you'll find what works best at each milestone.
