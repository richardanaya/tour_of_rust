- title: Chapter 1 - What Is WebAssembly?
  content_markdown: >
    WebAssembly is a binary format for representating isolated executable code. 
    It was developed for web

    browsers as an alternative to JavaScript with some distinct advantages:


    * Because its a low level bytecode, it's able to perform math quickly and
    manage memory more concisely.

    * WebAssembly was built with existing compilers in mind, allowing native
    languages like C/C++ and Rust to compile to it as a target.

    * Built with isolation in mind, allowing fine grain access control.

    * WebAssembly was built rather host agnostic, allowing some people to use
    WebAssembly [outside of browsers](https://wasmer.io/) too!


    WebAssembly is often called **WASM**
- title: Inside A Module
  content_markdown: >
    When you compile to a WebAssembly target your compiler should create a file
    ending in `.wasm` called a **module**.


    The module is a [binary
    format](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html) full of
    information on how a 

    wasm program and its memory should be setup and interacted with:

    * a list of functions

    * what functions should be exported/imported

    * what data should initially be in the wasm modules memory
- title: Loading A Module
  content_markdown: >
    Since a WebAssembly module is just a file of bytes. We first need to load
    those bytes in our browser.


    ```

    let file = await fetch('my_file.wasm');

    let bytes = await file.arrayBuffer();

    ```
- title: Creating a Module
  content_markdown: >
    Modules are created from bytes.


    ```

    let module = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes);

    ```


    During this phase we can **import** JavaScript functions we want our module
    to have access to. 

    We'll show an example of this next chapter.
- title: Using a Module
  content_markdown: >
    A module will have one or more **export** functions that are accessible to
    JavaScript. Typically

    there is some export function to call in order to start a wasm program (e.g.
    `main`, `start`).


    ```

    module.instance.main();

    ```

    Let's put our knowledge all together and make a WebAssembly

    module with a single **export** function `add` for adding two numbers, and
    put the

    results in HTML.


    `#[no_mangle]` tells our compiler to keep our function name human readable.
- title: Chapter 1 Conclusion
  content_markdown: >
    I hope it's clear that WebAssembly is not that complex fundamentally! In our
    next chapter we will 

    start looking into the details of how JavaScript and WebAssembly can talk
    about the same data.
